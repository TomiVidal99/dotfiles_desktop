# Tomás Vidal Dotfiles Desktop
__This is my personal configuration for my Arch installation in my desktop. Includes configuration for i3, i3status, neovim, and some custom scripts for Arch (volume control, connect to all paired bluetooth devices, etc.)__

# TODO
- [ ] Look up defx, and cofigure it.
- [ ] Create a file that contains the variable cwp and it's blacklisted in the gitignore, so when the path it's updated it doesn't mess with the repo.
- [ ] create script to pop a selection of some common nerd font icons to copy over with xclip.
- [ ] Improve dispc function to accept variables as more arguments to display information more easily.
- [ ] Fix octave syntax highlight.
- [ ] Add more plugs for octave.
- [ ] Improve configPlot with a different fontsize for the title and another one for the axis.
